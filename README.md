### Project Description:

#### Objective: Design, create, and analyze a database that meets specific business requirements.

Deliverables:

**PD1: Project Proposal, Database Design, and Data Exploration**

Due Date: 09/06/2024

Points: 10

Details:

- Part 1: Topic Selection

Select a relevant business topic or propose a new one. The topic should be aligned with the business needs and have sufficient data available for analysis.

- Part 2: Database Design

Design the database using data modeling techniques discussed in class, such as entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs), normalization, and schema definition.
Ensure the design supports the business objectives and can handle the necessary data efficiently.

- Part 3: Data Cleaning and Exploration

<u>Data Cleaning:</u>

Identify and address any inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers in the data.
Apply techniques such as removing duplicates, filling or dropping missing values, and correcting data types.
Document the cleaning steps taken and any assumptions made.

<u>Data Exploration:</u>

- Perform initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's structure and characteristics.
- Generate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) for key variables.
- Visualize the data through histograms, box plots, scatter plots, or other appropriate visualizations to identify patterns or anomalies.
- Highlight any interesting findings or potential issues that might impact the analysis in later stages.

**PD2: Database Creation**

Due Date: 09/16/2024

Points: 10

Details:

- Implement the designed database on a cloud-hosted platform.
- Ensure all tables, relationships, and constraints are correctly set up based on the design from PD1.
- Input a sample dataset to test the database's functionality and correctness.

**PD3: Data Analysis & Insights**

Due Date: 10/07/2024

Points: 10

Details:

- Measure and generate insights by analyzing three critical business metrics.
- Use SQL or other data analysis tools to extract meaningful patterns from the database.
- Visualize the insights and provide actionable recommendations based on the findings.
- Complete a peer review survey on team performance.

#### Timeline:

Week 1: Topic selection and initial discussion on database design.
Week 2: Finalize database design; start data cleaning and exploration.
Week 3-4: Create the database; test with a sample dataset.
Week 5-6: Conduct data analysis and generate insights.
Week 7: Complete peer review survey; finalize the project.

#### Tools & Technologies:

Database Management System (DBMS): e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL.
Cloud Platform: e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL.
Data Analysis Tools: e.g., SQL, Python with Pandas, Excel.
Visualization Tools: e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau.

#### Assessment Criteria:

PD1: Clarity of the topic, completeness of the database design, thoroughness of data cleaning and exploration, and adherence to data modeling principles.
PD2: Correct implementation of the database, effective use of cloud-hosted solutions, and adherence to the initial design.
PD3: Quality of insights generated, accuracy of metrics analysis, effectiveness of visualizations, and peer review feedback.
